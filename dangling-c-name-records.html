<h1>Exploiting Dangling C-Name Records for fun & profit</h1>
<br></br>
<i><small>Confidential domains are redacted in this blog post</small></i>
<h2>Discovery:</h2>
<p>One day I decided to do some recon on a bug bounty program I liked. This program has an open scope that includes all subdomains: <u>*.redacted.com</u></p>
<p>I ran their domain through my recon script, and took screenshots of all the found subdomains. Reviewing the screenshots, I discovered something that didn't look right.</p>
<p>A screenshot of <u>app.redacted.redacted.com</u> displayed this:</p>
<img src="./images/dangling-c-name-images/dangling-c-name-record.png" height="400px" width="500px">
<p>This immediately caught my attention for two reasons:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;1. I had run recon on this program before, and had never seen a screenshot that looked like this</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;2. hugedomains.com sounds like a place you sell domains, so my brain jumped to subdomain takeover</p>
<br></br>
<h2>Further introspection:</h2>
<p>At this point, I decided to use nslookup to learn more about this domain.</p>
<p>It turned out that <u>app.redacted.redacted.com</u> had a C-Name record pointing to a domain called redacted-arena.com, which was for sale on hugedomains.com</p>
<p>This explains why <u>app.redacted.redacted.com</u> was a hugedomains.com advertisment, it was serving content from the for sale domain! This means if we bought redacted-arena.com, we could serve whatever content we wanted on <u>app.redacted.redacted.com</u>!</p>
<p>I immediately checked the price of redacted-arena.com, 3295$! I cant afford that. '-.-</p>
<p>Despite not actually exploiting the dangling c-name, I reported the vulnerability through hackerone, and recieved a bounty. &#128516;</p>
